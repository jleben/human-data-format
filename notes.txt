### Plain scalars:

Plain scalars and keys in mappings should have the maximal freedom without making a document look confusing. That's a fuzzy statement, but it's still valuable.

Plain scalars must conform to a pre-defined type. Where a scalar is expected, it should have the longest possible text match.
That means it can even contain stuff like ": " or ", " or "[" etc...
The also means we have to define a type for plain words and indetifiers like "one two", "one_two", etc.

Nonetheless, scalar types should be defined without interfering with other syntax rules if at all possible. If some established syntax is not compatible, then a compatible alternative can be defined, with a well-defined relation. If that's really not possible or very inconvenient, the user can use the literal scalar form instead. One such example are regular expressions: they can not be a plain scalar, but they are already super complicated and forcing the user to use an alternative would be a nightmare. So a non-plain scalar form must be used.

Quoted strings are not part of core syntax. They are simply scalars like any other. A scalar type could be defined that is a quoted string that interprets escapes like \n and \t so user can enter these without actually breaking the structure of the document much.

A parser could expose control over the scalar types that they use.
Either a set of types to try in a particular order for any scalar, or a mapping between a path to the scalar and its type.

### Simplified flow collections

Flow forms do not contain nested collections. You can only have a flat list or a flat mapping.
So there's no need for brackets "[]{}" - you only need the comma to separate entries and the colon to separate keys and values:
Like this:
    one, two, three
Or:
    a: 1, b: 2, c: 3

Problem: Consider:
    a: 1, b: 2
Could this be confused and parsed as the following?
    { "a": { "1, b": "2" } }
Well,  no. If we don't allow nested structures, then after "a: " we would expect a scalar, and then ", " but not ": ".
So even if "1, b" got parsed as a scalar, then ": " would cause an error.


### Optional '-' for list and map entries

List entries don't need to be prefixed with '-'.
List and mapping entries are both optionally prefix with '-'.

Problems:

- Can't distinguish between a scalar and a list with one element. Maybe that's not important?

- Is the following a single mapping with 2 entries, or a list with 2 entries, each a mapping with 1 entry?
    key: value
    key: value
That could be solved by considering a key-value pair as own element.
A mapping is just a list of key-value pairs.
So the above is such a list / mapping, flat.

- The following two examples look very similar, but have a different structure.
  That's the same in YAML though:
One:
    - key: value
      key: value
Two:
    - key: value
    - key: value
